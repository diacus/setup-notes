#+title: Desktop Environment Setup Notes

I wrote this notes in an effort of not repeating my self every time I set up a
new desktop environment, so the steps I usually follow to achive the look and
feel I like are listed here

This personal notes are taken in [[https://orgmode.org][orgmode files]], with the intention of execute
the programatic instructions within [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. So the listing code blocs included
can be executed by simply typing =C-c= + =C-c= with the cursor over it.
