* Disable Keyboard

To display the keyboards (and other input devices) detected by your system, use the =xinput= command:

#+begin_src shell
xinput list
#+end_src

For this example, I want do disable my laptop's keyboard, which is labeled as
"AT Translated Set 2 Keyboard" according to this [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/160945/is-there-a-way-to-disable-a-laptops-internal-keyboard][Ask Ubuntu post]].

Folloing the instructions there. I can disable the keyboard by using the =float= subcommand

#+begin_src shell :var KEYBOARD_ID="14"
xinput float $KEYBOARD_ID
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :var KEYBOARD_ID="14" :var MASTER="3"
xinput reattach $KEYBOARD_ID $MASTER
#+end_src
