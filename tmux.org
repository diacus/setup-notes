#+title: Tmux Settings

Before configurating [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki][tmux]], make sure you have available the following packages
in your system:

- Tmux (>= v1.9)
- Git
- Github CLI

* Tmux Configuration
I have a public gist with the contents of =$HOME/.tmux.conf= file to install it
just run the code block below.

#+name: tmux-conf
: https://gist.github.com/diacus/60cdda7c425f864acfee309973abdda7

#+name: install-tmux-conf
#+begin_src shell :dir /tmp :var TMUX_CONF_GIST=tmux-conf
gh gist clone $TMUX_CONF_GIST tmux.d
mv tmux.d/.tmux.conf $HOME/
rm -rf tmux.d
#+end_src

Before to start tmux for the very first time, proceed to install the plugin
manager.

* Tmux Plugin Manager
Installing the plugin manager requires running v1.9 or higher. For details see
the repository on [[https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm][Github]].

#+name: install-tpm
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm $HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm
#+end_src

After entering tmux for the very first time, you will need to hit =C-c= + =I=
right away to tell TPM to install the missing plugins.
