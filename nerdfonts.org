I conic font aggregator, collection, and patcher. See the [[https://www.nerdfonts.com][official site]] for details

* How to install Nerd Fonts
Depending on your needs or choices go to [[https://www.programmingfonts.org/][programming fonts]], to have an idea of
what to expect from each available font.

For now I choose =Hasklug Nerd Font=, so I downloaded it under my [[file:~/.local/share/fonts][users's fonts directory]].

#+name: install-hasklug-nerd-font
#+begin_src shell :dir ~/.local/share/fonts
mkdir Hasklug
cd Hasklug

wget -q -O Hasklug.zip https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/Hasklig.zip
unzip Hasklug.zip
rm Hasklug.zip
#+end_src

In case you want to get rid of the font you installed, you just need to delete
the folder that contains it

#+name: uninstall-hasklug-nerd-font
#+begin_src shell :dir ~/.local/share/fonts
rm -rf Hasklug
#+end_src
